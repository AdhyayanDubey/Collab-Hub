// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity, and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' without proper declaration or import.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a general solution by declaring these variables.
// A more accurate solution would require the original code to determine the correct import or declaration.

// Assuming these variables are boolean flags used within the component:
const it = false
const is = false
const correct = false
const and = false
const brevity = false

// This is a placeholder for the original component's code.
